# Day 004

'Today was dedicated entirely to practicing Python, and despite the constraints of time and academic pressure, I successfully solved 12 problems. While it may not seem like a large number, these 12 problems were instrumental in refreshing and solidifying my understanding of Python. Each challenge helped reinforce key concepts and improve my coding skills, making the time spent both productive and valuable.'

Here are the questions that i solved:

    1. Write a function that rotates the elements of a list to the right by a given number of steps.
    2. Write a function that finds the most frequent element in a list. If there are multiple elements with the same highest frequency, return any one of them.
    3. Matrix multiplication
    4. Write a function to calculate the determinant of a square matrix. The function should take a square matrix (2D list) as input and return its determinant. Assume the matrix is non-empty and square.
    5. Implement the insertion sort algorithm to sort a list of integers in non-decreasing order.
    6. Implement the selection sort algorithm to sort a list of integers in non-decreasing order.
    7. Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string.
    8. Implement the binary search algorithm to search for a target value in a sorted list of integers. If the target is found, return its index; otherwise, return -1.
    9. Given a 9x9 matrix representing a sudoku board, write a function to determine if the board is valid. The board is valid if all rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
    10. find if a number is armstrong or not.

***ABOUT 180 DAYS OF PROGRAMMING***
“Driven by a passion for technology and personal growth, I’m embarking on a 180-day coding challenge. Over the next six months, I’ll learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, C, C++, React.js, Next.js, and Bootstrap step-by-step from scratch. My goal is to build proficiency and create impactful projects with ease, focusing on web development and machine learning. Using resources like W3Schools, official documentation, and ChatGPT, I’ll share daily progress on Facebook to stay motivated and inspire others. This journey from scratch aims to enhance my coding skills, boost my confidence, and open new career opportunities.”
