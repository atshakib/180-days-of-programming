Day 001

‘for the first day, I focused on learning the basics of various languages such as HTML, Java, Python, and JavaScript. The fundamental concepts are often similar across different languages, making it easier to diversify my learning. Although it might seem tiresome, this approach helped me build a solid foundation. ’

***ABOUT 180 DAYS OF PROGRAMMING***
“Driven by a passion for technology and personal growth, I’m embarking on a 180-day coding challenge. Over the next six months, I’ll learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, C, C++, React.js, Next.js, and Bootstrap step-by-step from scratch. My goal is to build proficiency and create impactful projects with ease, focusing on web development and machine learning. Using resources like W3Schools, official documentation, and ChatGPT, I’ll share daily progress on Facebook to stay motivated and inspire others. This journey from scratch aims to enhance my coding skills, boost my confidence, and open new career opportunities.”
