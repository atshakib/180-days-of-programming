‘With the final exam looming, my coding time has dwindled. Today, I prioritized problem-solving by tackling 10 Python challenges from ChatGPT and 2 Codeforces problems shared by a university friend. Additionally, I built a basic shopping cart website using JavaScript, although event handling remains unfinished. I plan to conquer event handling soon!’
